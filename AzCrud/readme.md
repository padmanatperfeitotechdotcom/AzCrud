# AzCrud - Azure CRUD with C<span>#</span> - An Azure Function App to simplify CRUD database access for small applications

The `HttpTrigger` makes it incredibly easy to have your functions executed via an HTTP call to your function. Hook onto this a bit of parsing and database code and we have a simple mechanism to map GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE command to SQL statements that do the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.
